# Offstage — Bot-free Desktop Meeting Recorder

**Track 2 submission by Farin Attar**

> The meeting recorder that never joins the meeting.

Offstage captures both sides of a call (your mic + system/meeting audio) entirely on your machine. No bot enters Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, or Slack. Recordings are written to disk every second so a crash never loses the call. When the meeting ends, Offstage sends the file to WhipScribe and gives you a clickable, speaker-labelled transcript with jump-to-second audio seeking.

## The Problem

1. **Bot invasion** — Tools like Otter, Fireflies and Read.ai join as visible third-party bots. Clients, candidates, and executives frequently refuse them. Confidential calls become impossible.
2. **Crash = total loss** — Most web recorders buffer multi-hour calls in RAM. One Windows freeze, Zoom crash or battery death and the entire recording is lost.
3. **Messy files** — Recordings end up as generic `meeting_final_v3.wav` files detached from calendar context.

Offstage solves all three.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Electron (Windows-first)
- **Audio Capture**: WASAPI loopback (system) + Web Audio API / MediaRecorder (mic)
- **Mixing**: Web Audio `AudioContext` + `ChannelMergerNode` → 16 kHz mono WebM/Opus
- **Persistence**: Node `fs.createWriteStream` via IPC (1-second disk flushes)
- **Calendar**: iCal feed (Google Calendar / Outlook / Apple Calendar) + sample meetings
- **Transcription**: WhipScribe API (`POST /api/v1/transcribe` → poll → fetch JSON)
- **UI**: Custom ink & teal dark glassmorphism (vanilla CSS, zero framework bloat)

## How to run

```bash
cd apps/farin/track2-recorder
npm install
npm start
```

1. Set your WhipScribe API key (via `.env` or the in-app secure DPAPI store).
2. (Optional) Paste your Google/Outlook private iCal URL in Calendar Settings, or use built-in samples.
3. Click **Arm** on an upcoming meeting (or click **Record** for an ad-hoc session).
4. Run the 5-second dual-track Soundcheck.
5. When the call ends, click **Stop & Transcribe** → Offstage uploads to WhipScribe and displays the interactive transcript.

## Visual Walkthrough

### 1. Calendar Arming & Pre-Call Soundcheck
*Arm upcoming calendar meetings with live countdowns and verify mic & room audio levels before entering the call.*

## What I deliberately left unfinished (and why)

- **macOS system-audio path (ScreenCaptureKit)**: Windows-first was the priority for Track 2. One platform done solidly beats two done poorly.
- **Multi-monitor Focus HUD auto-docking**: Works on primary display; multi-screen snapping left for next iteration.
- **Automatic cloud folder synchronization**: Transcripts and recordings remain local-first by default for maximum data privacy.

## Architecture decisions worth noting

- **Why 1-second chunks on disk?**
  RAM buffers lose everything on crash. Streaming directly to an open file descriptor ensures that minute 42 of an interview is safe even if the OS or process dies.
- **Why bot-free?**
  High-stakes conversations (recruiting, sales, executive 1-on-1s) often forbid bots. Local OS loopback removes the policy friction entirely.
- **Why local-first library?**
  Recordings and sensitive audio stay strictly on the user’s machine. WhipScribe is leveraged for AI transcription, diarization, and timestamps, rather than long-term audio custody.

## Privacy & Recording Ethics Guardrails

Offstage implements concrete privacy and data custody guardrails designed for high-stakes enterprise and recruiting environments:

1. **Local-Only Audio Custody**: Raw meeting audio and transcripts are stored exclusively in your local application directory (`userData/recordings/` and `userData/sessions/`). No third-party cloud audio bucket is ever used for custody.
2. **Hardware-Backed Credential Encryption**: API keys are never stored in plaintext JSON. Offstage encrypts keys at rest using Electron's `safeStorage` (backed by Windows DPAPI hardware-level OS user encryption).
3. **Transparent Non-Invasive Capture**: Offstage uses native OS audio loopback (`WASAPI` / desktop capturer) and local mic input. It operates entirely client-side without injecting bots, altering call audio streams, or triggering noisy meeting-room bot permissions.
4. **Crash-Safe Local Streaming**: In-progress calls are written to disk in 1-second chunks (`userData/sessions/<id>/chunks/*.webm`) rather than held in volatile RAM, preventing data loss without requiring external network sync during calls.
5. **Direct Ephemeral Transcription**: Audio is transmitted directly to the WhipScribe API via HTTPS solely for speech-to-text processing and speaker diarization, with no intermediary tracking or telemetry proxies.

## What We Learned & The Production Roadmap: The Zero-Bot Ecosystem

### Core Engineering Learnings
Building Offstage revealed why meeting bots are a fundamentally flawed architecture:
1. **The guest list is political**: In confidential board calls, sales pitches, and technical screens, admitting an uninvited bot creates friction. Capturing cleanly from the OS loopback is the only path that respects client privacy.
2. **RAM buffers are fragile**: Streaming 1-second audio chunks directly to an open disk descriptor is the difference between a resilient professional tool and a toy that loses a 2-hour call during a browser tab crash.

### Evolution & Next Milestones
- **Native macOS Audio Tap (ScreenCaptureKit)**: Windows-first loopback is solid; bringing the same zero-bot architecture to macOS via ScreenCaptureKit.
- **Direct CandidateSync & ATS Integration**: Automatic one-click export into candidate scorecards, Linear tickets, or Notion notes the second the call disconnects.
- **Zero-Knowledge Encrypted Vault**: Optional end-to-end encrypted cloud backup where only the user holds the decryption keys.
- **Enterprise Redaction Shields**: Real-time on-device regex & PII masking for credit card numbers, passwords, and sensitive client credentials.
