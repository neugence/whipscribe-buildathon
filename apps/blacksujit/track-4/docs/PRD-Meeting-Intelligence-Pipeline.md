# PRD: Meeting Intelligence Pipeline (Track 4)
**Product:** CallCoach — Investment Readiness QA for Founders  
**Author:** Buildathon Team  
**Date:** September 2026  
**Status:** MVP in Development  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Seed-stage founders manage 20+ investor calls per week. Each call is critical data, but founders are too deep in conversation to audit themselves. Existing tools (Otter, Fireflies) solve for **content** ("What was said?"). They fail at **quality** ("How well was the meeting run?").

### Cost of the Gap
- **Missed commitments**: 60% of founder-investor action items are never followed up on (Harvard Business Review, 2025).
- **Pitch stagnation**: Founders repeat the same flawed narrative, unaware investors show recurring tension at specific points.
- **Deal slippage**: Without systematic feedback, founders lose deals to competitors who iterate faster.

### Our Solution

**CallCoach** transforms raw audio into a **Managerial Scorecard**. Using WhipScribe's API as our transcription backbone and a multi-agent AI pipeline for analysis, we provide:
1.  Per-call Quality Reports (Compliance, Clarity, Friction, Action Items)
2.  Cross-call Trend Analysis (Are you improving week over week?)
3.  Prescriptive Coaching (Not "what happened," but "how to fix it")

### Key Innovation

While competitors stop at a single-call scorecard, CallCoach builds a **coaching loop** across a portfolio of calls. The core insight: **"One call is data. A week of calls is a coaching signal. A multi-week trend is a performance engine."**

## 2. Research Artifacts

### 2.1 Competitive Landscape & Benchmarking

| Product | Core Strength | Output Type | Limitations |
|---------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Otter.ai** | Real-time transcription | Live notes | No analysis layer, no coaching |
| **Fireflies.ai** | AI summaries & insights | Summary dashboard | Single-call focus, no trend learning |
| **Gong.io** | Revenue team intelligence | Call library | $100+/mo, enterprise-only, not founder-focused |
| **Chorus.ai** | Conversation intelligence | Deal reviews | Sales-rep focused, steep learning curve |
| **Avaamo** | Conversational AI | Analytics | Over-automated, lacks human-readable insight |

**CallCoach Differentiation Matrix**

| Dimension | Existing Tools | CallCoach |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Analysis Depth** | Keyword extraction | Multi-agent AI (4 specialists) |
| **Evidence** | Highlighted quotes | Timestamp-grounded evidence |
| **Trend Learning** | Single call | Cross-call pattern detection |
| **Coaching** | Descriptive summary | Prescriptive recommendations |
| **Commitment Tracking** | None | Action item lifecycle (Resolved/Slipped) |
| **Price Point** | $10-100+/mo | Built on WhipScribe ($0.99 first + $/hr) |
| **Target Persona** | Sales teams | Seed-stage founders |

### 2.2 User Research (Synthesized)

**Primary Persona: Sarah**
- Customer Success Manager at $10M ARR SaaS
- Manages 3 SDRs, 15-20 customer calls/week
- Reads full transcripts (30-60 min/week), tracks issues in Google Docs
- Misses ~30% of commitments weekly, delayed feedback (2-3 days)

**Secondary Persona: The Founder**
- Runs 20+ investor calls/week
- Needs: "Will this investor give me the round?" not "What was said?"
- Pain point: Vague feedback, can't self-audit objectively

### 2.3 Market Gap Analysis

**Buildathon Landscape** (from track-4-workflow.md):
Most Track 4 submissions follow a single-call pattern:
- Meeting scorecard (no time comparison)
- Interview evaluator (not a repeatable coaching loop)
- Support QA assistant (no team-level trends)
- Specialty note-taker (not operational for daily coaching)
- Task extractor (weak evidence, little pattern learning)

**Shared Weakness:** They stop at a single meeting result. They miss "learning from a series of calls, surfacing recurring problems, and converting them into action."

## 3. Product Vision & Strategy

### 3.1 Vision Statement
*Transform raw business communication recordings into an AI-powered coaching engine that turns every conversation into measurable performance improvement.*

### 3.2 Product Strategy (6 Points)

1.  **Solve one real job for one real user:** QA for founder-investor calls
2.  **Make the workflow visible:** Upload → Analyze → Dashboard → Coach
3.  **Show live evidence:** Timestamp-grounded quotes from WhipScribe transcripts
4.  **Demonstrate comparison:** Multi-call trend analysis on `/trends`
5.  **Build a coaching layer:** Prescriptive feedback on `/coach`
6.  **Record the proof:** 2-minute demo of the full pipeline

### 3.3 One-Year Vision

| Quarter | Milestone |
|---------|-----------|
| Q1 | Core MVP: Single-call analysis, scorecard, evidence viewer |
| Q2 | Cross-call trends: Compare 5+ calls, detect recurring patterns |
| Q3 | Coaching engine: Personalized recommendations, speaker-level analysis |
| Q4 | CRM Integration: Push scores to HubSpot/Salesforce as risk flags |
| Year 2+ | Macro view for CEOs: Organization-wide communication health |

## 4. Design Specification

### 4.1 Visual Language (Based on WhipScribe Source)

**Design Tokens:**
```css
--paper: #fbfcf8;           /* Off-white paper background */
--ink: #171817;             /* Warm near-black text */
--muted: #737b6e;           /* Subtle grays */
--lime: #c5f44b;            /* Brand accent (used sparingly) */
--lime-panel: #edfbd3;      /* Lime background panel */
--rule: #dfe4da;            /* Thin divider lines */
--sans: "Space Grotesk";    /* Primary font */
--mono: "IBM Plex Mono";    /* Mono font for evidence/timestamps */
```

**Typography Hierarchy:**
- Display: `Space Grotesk` (Editorial headings)
- Body: `Space Grotesk` (Clean readability)
- Evidence/Timestamps: `IBM Plex Mono` (Monospace precision)

**Layout Contract (From design.md):**
- Max content width: 1120px
- Desktop padding: 28px / Mobile: 18px
- Hero: Two-column (copy ↔ upload), collapses at 760px
- Rules over shadows, editorial spacing over SaaS card grids
- Lime reserved for upload affordances, active tabs, links

## 6. API Contract Specification

### 6.1 Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description | Response |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Service health check | `{status: "ok"}` |
| `POST` | `/api/upload` | Upload file, submit to WS, analyze | `{job_id, score, success}` |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs` | List all completed jobs | `{jobs: [...], success}` |
| `GET` | `/api/report/:jobId` | Get single report | `{evaluation, transcript, audio_url}` |
| `GET` | `/api/trends-data` | Get trend metrics | `{labels, overall, velocity, momentum}` |
| `GET` | `/api/coach-data` | Get coaching insights | `{coach_response}` |

### 6.2 Multi-Agent Evaluator

Four specialized agents run in parallel via `call_llm`:

| Agent | Purpose | Key Output |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Commitments** | Track explicit promises | List of commitments with timestamp |
| **Friction** | Detect micro-tensions | Tension signals with quotes |
| **Narrative** | Find clarity gaps | Vague language, hedging |
| **Velocity** | Extract action items | New items + resolved items |

**Synthesis:** A "Chief Reviewer" LLM call synthesizes all findings into:
- Overall Score (0-100)
- Deal Killer (top risk)
- Category Scores
- Strategic Pivots (prescriptive advice)

**Evidence Guardrail:** `clean_json_output()` extracts JSON from LLM output. `_verify_evidence()` cross-references AI quotes against raw transcript segments to prevent hallucinations.

## 8. Success Metrics

### 8.1 North Star Metric
**Average Deal Velocity Score increase across user's call portfolio over 30 days**

### 8.2 Supporting Metrics
| Metric | Target (MVP) | Measurement |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Analysis accuracy | 90%+ verified | % issues with timestamp evidence |
| Review time saved | 75% | Time to score vs manual review |
| Call-to-call improvement | +15% avg | Score delta across 5+ calls |
| Commitment capture | 85%+ | Action items found in transcript |
| UI feedback score | 4.5/5 | Post-session survey (future) |

### 8.3 Validation Criteria
Before PR, we must demonstrate:
1. Upload a 5-minute founder-investor pitch recording
2. Analyze it with the multi-agent pipeline
3. Show the AI-generated report with scores, deal killers, and action items
4. Show timestamp-grounded evidence (quotes linked to the transcript)
5. Demonstrate cross-call comparison on `/trens`
6. Run the full flow from start to finish in under 2 minutes
